# Theatre-Ticket-Booking-System
The system helps to book theatre's tickets, The project has been compared to a real time engine. Data structure -stack has been used in the project(if you book a ticket of a particular movie and again when you go to purchase the ticket , the ticket which had been previously purchased that seat number will be shown as booked.) You can even cancel the ticket one purchased and even see the details of the ticket purchased. The admin can even change the price of ticket if he/she enters the right password, when he/she types the password the characters will be replaced with "*" for security purposes.
